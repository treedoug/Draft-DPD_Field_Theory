\section{What goes in the SI}
% {{{
The SI holds figures, tables and other data that are relevant to your paper, but are too long to include in the main article.
This may include a derivation of a result that isn't essential, or some figure that provides due diligence, but isn't really very interesting (e.g. plot of an autocorrelation time).
You can also usually submit an electronic SI that includes videos for inclusion with the article.

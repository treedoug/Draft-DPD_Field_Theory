# PaperTemplate
A "fork-able" template for writing a paper via LaTeX

## How to Use this Repo to Write a Paper

Congratulations, you are preparing to write a paper!
Writing a paper is one of the most important parts of doing research.
It is how data gets transmitted to the scientific community and how you get credit for doing the work.
Good researchers start writing the paper while they are planning and executing their research.

Before you proceed, please read the short (3 page) [article](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/adma.200400767) (a copy is also in the notes/ directory) by George Whitesides on how to write a paper. 
It is excellent and we will bascially follow the steps he outlines below.
([This article](https://spie.org/news/photonics-focus/janfeb-2020/how-to-write-a-scientific-paper?utm_id=ztwz) by Andrea Armani is also very nice.)

It will probably also be useful for you to look at a few papers for examples of what do to.
One place to look is [our group publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ByuBvdUAAAAJ&hl=en).
Focus on the structure of the papers, the way the sections are organized, etc. instead of the actual contents of the paper.

### Fork the repository
First, fork this repository; a fork is simply a copy where you are the owner.
Since you want to be able to make changes and merge without my permission, and because you do not want to merge back into the template, please make a fork (as opposed to a branch).

### Become familiar with LaTeX
I require that you write all of your papers (and prospectus and proposals) in LaTeX.
If you are not already familiar with LaTeX, spend a few minutes learning about it.
There are many tutorials available online, but [this one](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes) by Overleaf seems pretty good.
The [LaTeX wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX) is also an excellent referece.

In addition, you will need a LaTeX editor to write your documents.
There are several choices:
- Command line. If you use Linux (or Linux subsystem for Windows), you can simply use vim and the command line.
This gives you the most control but also has the largest activation barrier.
You may need to [install texlive](https://dzone.com/articles/installing-latex-ubuntu), if it isn't already installed.
- [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) is a web-based interface for using LaTeX.
This is essentially "Google Docs" for LaTeX.
It is currently very popular, but has a "freemium" subscription model.
Basically, you can use it for free, but the advanced features require paying.
- [Lyx](https://www.lyx.org/) is an easier option for using LaTeX if you don't want to use Overleaf, but you don't feel comfortable with the command line. It is available on Linux, Windows and Mac.

Most journals provide document classes for LaTeX that allow for easy submission.
The ACS uses the package [achemso](https://ctan.org/pkg/achemso?lang=en) and the APS uses [revtex](https://journals.aps.org/revtex).
The template provided here uses achemso, but it is relatively easy to switch if you need to.
Please use one of these packages unless you know better.

### Do a Literature Review
Before making an outline, you should spend some time thinking about how your work is situated within the literature.
Begin gathering the references you will need for your bibliography and store them in your preferred bibliography management software ([Jabref](http://www.jabref.org/), [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/), [Endnote](https://endnote.com/), etc.).
To help you as you read the literature, make a "Literature Review" document (e.g. in OpenOffice or Word) to record a few thoughts (in your own words) about the papers you read.
Store these documents in the `notes` directory (see the given examples).

### Make an outline
As instructed by Whitesides, make an outline of your paper.
Do this in the LaTeX document `manuscript.tex` (see the document for additional help and instructions).
To make the outline, follow these steps:

1. Get out a blank piece of paper and write down, in any order, all the important ideas that you have concerning your paper.
These should include questions like "Why am I doing this work?", "What does it mean?", "What hypotheses am I testing?", "What results do I have or expect?", "What have others done?", "What is the prior state-of-the-art?"
As part of this process, *sketch out (by hand) all of the possible figures and schematics* that you have generated or will generate.

2. Organize your ideas into three main sections:

    I. Introduction (Why did I do the work?)
    II. Results and Discussion (What did I do?)
    III. Conclusions (What does it mean?)

3. Take each of the sections and organize them on a finer scale.
Pay particular attention to how you organize the data and *figures*.
Think about the story you are telling and how the paper will make the most logical sense when put together.
*This may (and often does) include data you do not have or a figure you had not considered making previously*.
One reason to make an outline early is to anticipate these types of logical holes.

At this stage, you will want to type up your ideas in `manuscript.tex.`
Typically your outline will only be a couple of pages long, will include only a few complete paragraphs and will have only a few key references.
Put "placeholder figures" or scanned hand-drawings as stand-ins for the acutal figures you will make.
It takes a long time to make figures; do not spend the time at this point.
However, it is usually useful to add a caption that describes what the figure will contain.

4. Once you have an outline, bring it (or email it) to me.
I will give my opinion, suggest changes and give it back to you.
We will typically iterate several times before we come to an outline that we agree on.

### Fill in your outline
Once your outline is complete, you are ready to take data and write your paper!
As noted by Whitesides, it is much more efficient to write your paper *while you take data.*
Having the paper you want to write in mind will help guide you to make good decisions about what calculations ("experiments") you need to run and what analysis you need to do.
As Whitesides says:
> Do not, under any circumstances, wait until the collection of data is 'complete' before starting to write an outline. 
> No project is ever complete and it saves enormous effort and much time to propose a plausivle paper and outline as soon as you see the basic structure of a project.

## Directories

### codes
This directory should store the code or codes used to generate the raw data.
Typically this will be a copy of the simulation software you used, e.g. PFPD or MCPC.
Analysis and plotting scripts will not normally be stored here.

### data
This directory should store (i) *raw* data and (ii) the post-processed data and accompanying analysis scripts.
As described below, this directory should follow the principles outlined in the group data management plan (see `notes/Data_Management_Plan.odt`).
Do not store "garbage" data in this directory.
If you discover that the data is bad or that the runs have failed, please delete the data.
(If you are still developing or debugging a code, you may have use some data that is useful but that may not fit with a paper.
Store this data in a separate directory.)

Typically, your data should be organized into "experiments" that were performed on a certain date (or range of dates).
For example, suppose that you are running the Monte Carlo Polymer Crystallization (MCPC) code written by Pierre, and you are calculating the internal energy as a function of temperature using the parallel/CUDA code.
You would store do your runs and then store your data in a directory named `E_versus_T_parallel.2019-04-23`.
The data would be stored in a sub-directory named `raw_data`.
Any analysis you perform should then be stored in another sub-directory named `analysis`.
This could include Excel sheets, python scripts, preliminary plots, etc. that you are using to understand the data.

Because this directory can hold a large amount of data, it will be ignored by the git repository.
More information about this directory and how it is backed up is detaled below.

### figures
This directory stores the figures that will be in your paper or supplementary information.
This directory should not include analysis scripts or raw data, but rather should only include the data necessary to make plots.
Unlike the data directory, the figures directory *will* be stored in the git repository, so care should be taken about the size of files used here.

Each figure should be stored in a separate sub-directory (e.g. fig-placeholder) inside figures.
I typically name all of my figures with a prefix "fig-", as shown in the example.
I do this so that my directory name, figure file-name and LaTeX reference are all the same, so I can easily keep track of the figures when I write.

Inside each figure sub-director (e.g. fig-placeholder), you should have a fig-data sub-directory where you put the files you are using to plot your data.
Typically, these files will be copied from the analysis subdirectory of one of the experiments in your data directory.
You should make a note of where these files come from in a file named data\_paths.txt, so someone else (including you at a later date) can easily find the source location later.

You should make your files in a plotting tool that can draw publication quality figures.
Python, gnuplot and Matlab can all do this, but *Excel cannot*.
You should save your files in a vector format like .eps or .pdf.
Most journals prefer the .eps format.

If you need to draw something, i.e. make a schematic, you should use a vector drawing program like Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator.
This will allow you to save the figure in a vector format.
Do not use a bitmap drawing program like Gimp or Adobe Photoshop.

### manuscript
This directory should contain:
- The manuscript LaTeX file: `manuscript.tex`
- The supplemental information LaTeX file: `suppinfo.tex`
- The references .bib file: `refs.bib`
- A copy of all of the figures in .eps format

When you run pdfLaTeX on the manuscript.tex file (either on your machine or in Overleaf) you will generate a manuscript.pdf file with your figures.
A number of other files (e.g. `mauscript.log`, `manuscript.bbl`) will also be generated.
These latter files tell help LaTeX run or tell you what it did.
You can delete these if you want.

### notes
This directory is a place for you to store any notes, files or scripts that you want tracked in the repository but that don't fit elsewhere in the directory structure.
This is an especially good place to store your notes on the Literature and bibliography.
I typically made a "Literature Review" document that summarizes the main points of important papers to help me when I'm reading.

### revisions
This directory is a place to track different stages of the revision process, including correspondence with co-authors and with journals.
For example, you typically need to write a cover letter to the editor of the journal when you submit the paper.
This directory is useful for storing these types of things.

### sh
This directory stores some shell scripts that are useful when writing the paper.
It currently includes:
- maketex.sh: a script for rendering your LaTeX files
- cleantex.sh: a script for deleting the "extra" files generated when pdflatex runs
- makediff.sh: a script that creates a .pdf file highlighting what was changed from the last version of the document.
- syncdata.sh: a script for syncing the data directory to the CAEDM group drive
- getdata.sh: a script for syncing the CAEDM group drive to your data directory

## Storing Data

Every paper has raw data associated with it.
It is a good practice to store the raw data alongside the paper in a data/ directory.
Unfortunately, git isn't a very useful tool for storing data.
Every time you commit a replace a data file with a new one, it makes a copy, and this can end up generating huge repositories.
This is bad, because it then takes forever to clone, commit, push and pull from repos, and we end up having to pay GitHub to store our data.
We definitely don't want to do this, since we typically generate GBs (and sometimes TBs) of data!
To avoid this, follow this rule: **Do not store your raw data in a directory that is tracked via git**.

To help you keep this rule, I have set up a "data/" directory inside the paper template repository, but its contents are not included when you commit or push your repository.
This is done via the .gitignore file inside the repository's main directory.
This ensures that you can store your data locally along with your paper, but keep it out of the git repository.

However, you still probably want your data to be backed up and shared with others.
To facilitate this, I have added a "hook" that runs every time you push your commits back to the repo.
The hook is a bash script that syncs your data directory to the CAEDM ssh server.
This way your data stays backed up, and you can easily access it anytime you need to.
Additionally, others in the group who are working on the paper should have access to your data and vice versa.
Anytime you clone or pull from the repo, you can also sync your local data folder with the CAEDM server to your local machine.

One quick technical note about the pre-push hook: If you use Overleaf to store your paper and git to sync your data, Overleaf removes the execution permissions from the script that does the syncing. Enter this command
```
git config core.fileMode false
chmod u+x sh/syncdata.sh 
```
into the head directory of the repository, and it will make Overleaf stop overwriting this permission locally.

### Setting up Data Storage
* Set up ssh keys to the CAEDM ssh server
* Make sure you have access to the "softmatter" CAEDM group

### Pushing your data to CAEDM SSH
Notes: 
* This copies data from your local machine to the CAEDM server.
If the files are large, this can take a long time.  
* Because the files in data are not part of the repo (i.e. they are ignored via .gitignore), 
updating these files will change the repo.
In other words, you will not see a change to the git status when you change files inside data.

* Automatically: make a commit and then run a git push. (*Only works when you have changes to the other files in the repository.*)
* Manually: run sh/syncdata.sh from the main directory of the repository. (*Works anytime.*)

### Getting your data from CAEDM SSH
Notes: 
* This copies data from your local machine to the CAEDM server.
If the files are large, this can take a long time.  
* Retrieving data from the external server can only be done manually.
This is to avoid possibly long retrival times the first time you clone the repo.

* Manually: run sh/getdata.sh from the main directory of the repository.
